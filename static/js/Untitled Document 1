You can represent the project creation components in json and swap them out 
depending on the type of project.  The suggesting starting project will have in
its initial form:
 - a mission mashup field
 - a title character field
 - a location geo field
You can customize which of these are on the project creation page for a 
different template.

You can also customize the things that will appear in a users wafinder once 
they're on the project page.  Wayfinder items may be wizards, readings, 
instructions, checklists, recurring calendar items, etc.

For now, they'll be wizards and site-specific things.  We want to make sure that
we're smartly integrating with outside services (like calendars, blogs, event
sites, etc.).

On the site, there should be something that says "Want a template for your 
organization?  Contact us and we'll work with you to get it done."  And we 
should work with people on this as long as their template empowers people to
solve community problems.




Levels of abstraction:
    - Level 0
        - Pre-constructed ejs templates for wizards
        - One set of pre-defined project creation paths
        - Same wayfinder items for all people/projects
    - Level 1
        - Pre-defined set of wizards in ejs templates
        - Project creation path set defined in data (using wizard templates)
        - Wayfinder item set defined in data
    - Level 2
        - Hard-coded contexts for wizards; dynamic ejs templates
        - Pre-defined set of project creation paths for each recipe
        - Wayfider item set defined per recipe
